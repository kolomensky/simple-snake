# Hello Snake!

**Snake** is a 1998 mobile video game created by Taneli Armanto as one of the three games included in the Nokia 6110 cellular phone. In the game, the player controls a snake in a playing field, collecting orbs which give the player points and make the snake grow in size while avoiding the walls and the snake's own longer body.
